## this is my BookMark app for week three of the thinkful corse 


[x]I can add bookmarks to my bookmark list. Bookmarks contain:

[x]title
[x]url link
[x]description
[x]rating (1-5)
[x]I can see a list of my bookmarks when I first open the app

All bookmarks in the list default to a "condensed" view showing only title and rating
[x]I can click on a bookmark to display the "detailed" view

Detailed view expands to additionally display description and a "Visit Site" link
[x]I can remove bookmarks from my bookmark list

[x]I receive appropriate feedback when I cannot submit a bookmark

Check all validations in the API documentation (e.g. title and url field required)
[x]I can select from a dropdown (a <select> element) a "minimum rating" to filter the list by all bookmarks rated at or above the chosen selection

[.](Extension feature - optional) I can edit the rating and description of a bookmark in my list
